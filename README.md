# ParkingMeter_Interface
A redesign of the Minneapolis parking meter interface paystation and meter improvements. 
The first step within this design process was to conduct user research to provide and understanding of the users' characteristics, behaviors, and goals for this specific product. 

To begin this design process, I conducted a set of exercises to determine initial thoughts and feelings about the current interface design. 

A storyboarding exercise was conducted to articulate current personal observations of the parking meter interface and pay station. 

Storyboard:

Direct and indirect observations took place to begin user research, including a "fly on the wall" exercise where users were observed from afar and reactions, specific characteristics, and behaviors were noted. 

Fly on the wall exercise:

Personas were then created based off of observations and an understanding of users' involvement and insight. By observing the users insights, frustrations, goals, and psychological traits a general understanding of the users was collected. 

Created were fictitious personas developed from realistic and detailed users, these personas were created with some fictitious information to provoke empathy yet contained vivid and specific understandings of their characteristics and behaviors. 

Main Persona:

Secondary Persona:

Key factors were pulled from each persona:

Main
* 50+ years of age
* Inexperienced with technology
* Does not live in the city/infrequent visitor

Secondary
* City dweller
* Time sensitive
* Technology savvy

Development and Completion of Ideation Process

With the user research and personas identified there was a clear understanding of the needs, goals, desires, and problems with the current Minneapolis parking meter interface and pay station. 

Pain points were developed based on the observations and reactions of the users. The pain points were broken up into three categories: major, minor, and pleasure. 

Pain Points:

Based off of the observations and pain points, it was concluded that the major problems/focus are as follows:
* Space number is difficult to remember
* Pay station process takes too long
* Major lack of feedback with pay station screen and keyboard
* Complete user journey by informing use of receipt 

After developing which points are the most important (major pain points) the ideation process began with simplistic sketches and interface designs.

The final ideation for this interface was a compilation of all initial ideas/designs.

Initial Design

From the final ideation an initial design for the parking meter, pay station, and ticket was created.

Low Fidelity Research and Testing

With the initial design in mind, phase 1 testing began with focus groups discussions. A low fidelity paper prototype was created to be used for phase 2 testing. 

During phase 1 testing, users were placed into focus groups to facilitate interactive discussions and were presented with three specific questions regarding the product. User groups consisted of two facilitators and four participants.  

Questions presented during testing:
* ”Was it easy for you to remember the space number. What did you do if you couldn’t or to help you remember it?” 
* ”Tell us what you did with the receipt if you got one. Were you satisfied if you did or didn’t get one?”
* ”Talk about your experience the last time you used the current pay station.”

Outcomes:

Specific Details/Product Features:
* Liked coin/cash option
* Lack of instructions
* Small Screen
* Forgetting time left
* Forgot space number 
* Walked back to car to see number 

Environmental Features:
* Rushed
* Busy
* Small Area
* Far Away

Emotions:
* Frustration
* Confusion
* Content
* Unhappy


Phase 1 testing outcomes allowed for an observation of users reactions, likes and dislikes, and specific details regarding environment and product. These outcomes were implemented within the design process to enhance positive outcomes and diminish the negative.

Phase 2 Testing

During phase 2 testing, users were prompted to complete a process with an objective of paying for parking for 1 hour. Users were split into groups where one would be prompted to use cash while the other to use a credit card. This test prompted users to think out loud and speak freely throughout their process and interaction with the paper prototype. 

Low fidelity paper prototype

Results concluded with users generating positive feedback with not having to remember ticket number. Negative feedback such as lack of a back button, confusing time scroll, and unnecessary feedback allowed for improvements moving forward into the mid fidelity interface mockups. 

Mid Fidelity Wireframes

Mid Fidelity wireframes created to show the basic ideation of the user interface for the parking meter pay station.

Mid Fidelity Testing

Phase 1 testing for mid fidelity prototype prompted users to complete a think out loud test on the initial wireframe interactive mockups. 

A scenario was given for users to complete an objective of paying for one hour with either cash or credit card. 

The results are as follows:

* "It would be helpful to see the rate when paying with a card"
* "Should be clearer that you need to grab a number at the pole next to your car first"
* Found disconnect between user and ease of prototype 
 
 High Fidelity Prototype
 
 High fidelity prototypes were created with an improved interface and design with an emphasis on usability for various types of users. 

High fidelity prototypes were created using Adobe XD software and can be interacted with [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/db4b773c-af84-4669-999c-f09072c50a1e/).

High Fidelity Testing

Testing for the high fidelity prototype was crucial to determine the if the necessary improvements were positively affecting users. 

High fidelity testing included a semantic differential test between the mid fidelity prototype and the high fidelity prototype. 

Mid fidelity testing results:

High fidelity testing results:

![high](https://github.com/MichelePiot/ParkingMeter_Interface/blob/master/ProjectFiles/High%20fidelity%20semantic%20testing%20outcomes.png)

The semantic differential test between the two prototypes included phrases that were similar and concluded the same meaning yet used some different words to rid users of complete word association between the two prototypes. 

Concluded results show positive indications that the high fidelity prototype gives more helpful and positive attitudes from users. 

Final Prototype

The final prototype includes a full remake of the pay station with a modern yet intuitive and useable design. 

This product was designed based on the needs of the current users. Relating back to the personas, the 50+ user would be able to maneuver the simplistic design and process even while somewhat technologically challenged. Even though an infrequent city visitor, this user would not struggle with paying at the pay station even through the hustle and bustle of a big city. There would be no frustration with having to remember a space number or where the ticket and receipt went. This prototype helps the user to complete their goals and ease their frustration with new technology or big cities. 

The secondary persona benefit from this improved prototype because the simplicity of the interface allows the user to complete their goal of paying for time quickly and with ease. Generally technology savvy, this user won't struggle with needing to remember their ticket or space number and can focus on getting where they need to go. The user's goals are completed and saves not only time but frustration of having to take the extra steps and pay for a parking spot.
